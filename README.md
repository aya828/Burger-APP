# Burger App

This Burger App uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize, and follows the MVC design pattern, using Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Users will input the names of burgers they would like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger name, the app will display the burger on the left side with a DEVOUR button. When the user clicks the DEVOUR button, the burger will be moved to the right side of the page. The burger will appear in the database and will show whether it has been devoured or not.
